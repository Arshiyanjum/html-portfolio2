<h1>About Me</h1>
Hi there!
<p>I'm Arshiya Anjum, a software developer with 2 years of experience building scalable, user-friendly applications. My passion lies in solving complex problems with clean, efficient code, and I thrive in collaborative environments where continuous learning is key.</p>
<p>Over the years, I've honed my expertise in a range of technologies including JavaScript, React, Node.js, and SQL/MongoDB.</p> In a previous role at [Previous Company Name], I led the development of a new service that improved response time by 40% and enhanced system reliability. I am a detail-oriented problem-solver who believes in the power of well-structured code and exceptional user experience.
<p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring open-source projects or mentoring aspiring developers in my local community. I'm always eager to learn about emerging technologies and take on new challenges.</p>
